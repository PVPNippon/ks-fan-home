This Addendum outlines the types of data collected from Admins, the purposes of such collection, and how this data is processed and shared to provide This Service effectively. By using This Application as an Admin, you agree to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information as described in this Addendum.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Addendum should be read in conjunction with the main Privacy Policy available at [link]. Where there are discrepancies, the terms outlined in this Addendum will prevail for Admins.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Article 2 (Additional Information we collect and how do we use them)</h2>
    <p>
        As an Admin of This Application, we collect and store the following information in addition to the information detailed in the main Privacy Policy:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Facebook Token:</strong> When you link your Facebook account to This Application, we store a Facebook token that allows us to access and share your Facebook posts with this App’s users. You can revoke access to your Facebook account from the Admin dashboard within the application. The token is stored securely and is deleted immediately upon revocation of access.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>YouTube Data:</strong> When you link your YouTube account to This Application, we store a YouTube token that allows us to access your YouTube channel for uploading videos. You can revoke access to your YouTube channel from the Admin dashboard within the application or by revoking consent in Google's security settings at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/security">Google Security Settings</a>. We also store the video ID created after an upload to display the video to users. If consent is not granted within 30 calendar days, we will delete the link to these videos to comply with YouTube’s privacy policy. By using the YouTube upload feature, you consent to YouTube and its third parties storing, accessing, or collecting information via cookies or similar technology.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Uploaded Content:</strong> Any images you upload to the App are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage, provided by Google Firebase. All data is securely stored in Japan, accessible only by authorized users or our application, and is protected by encryption and strict access controls. Content is retained as long as necessary for the purpose it was collected and is deleted upon request.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Event Information:</strong> When you create events within the App and link them to external ticket-selling websites, we collect and store event details in Firestore.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Email Address:</strong> Your email address is stored when you perform sensitive actions (e.g., connecting a YouTube account, sending an email or notification, posting an event). This information is used to facilitate these actions and ensure security.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Communication Content:</strong> We record the content of all communications (emails and notifications) sent from the app. These records are securely stored and used to demonstrate compliance with legal obligations or in case of legal disputes. The data is retained for as long as legally required or until it is no longer needed for this purpose.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        You can contact us at any time with questions or complaints about the Application's privacy practices.

    <h2>Article 3 (Additional permissions requests)</h2>

        When accessing This Service as an Admin, we may request access to your device’s storage for the file picker functionality, which is used to upload pictures from your gallery to Firebase Cloud Storage and videos to the YouTube channel as mentioned on the upload page. This access is strictly limited to the files you select and is necessary for managing content directly uploaded to the platform through Admin functionalities. No other data from your device's storage is accessed or collected.
    </p>
    <p>
        This access is performed with your explicit consent, which you provide when using the file picker. You may manage or revoke this access at any time through your device settings. Videos uploaded to YouTube are processed according to Google privacy policies and YouTube terms of service, which can be reviewed at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://m.youtube.com/terms">YouTube Terms of Service</a>.

    </p>
    <p>
        We implement security measures to protect your content during transfer, including HTTPS encryption and secure API calls, ensuring that your data remains protected during the upload process.
    </p>
